One of a set of ordered partitions of an experimental unit's participation in a study. An Epoch represents a state within a study such that subjects in separate arms within that state are comparable.

Each epoch serves a purpose in the trial as a whole, typically exposing the subject to a treatment or preparing them for a treatment, or gathering post-treatment data.Â  Activities and activity results control the subject's movement from one epoch to another.

A study designed to assess the effects of treatments might have 3 epochs.

A path through the study which describes what activities the study subject or experimental unit will be involved in as they pass through the study, and is typically equivalent to a treatment group in a parallel design trial. Generally, each subject is assigned to an arm, and the design of the study is reflected in the number and composition of the individual arms. This intended path through which the subject progresses in a trial is composed of time point events for each epoch of the study. Each time point event, in turn, has a pattern of child time points through which the subject would pass. This planned path thus describes how subjects assigned to the arm will be treated.

A study could have 2 arms named IV-Oral and Oral-IV.Â  The name IV-Oral reflects a path that passes through IV treatment, then Oral treatment.

The term "protocol" is somewhat overloaded and must be qualified to provide semantic context.Â  Therefore the term "study protocol" was chosen to disambiguate it from other protocols. 

In previous versions of BRIDG, there was one class for StudyProtocol.Â  However this too represented multiple distinct aspects of the semantics of study protocol, each of which have now been split into separate classes:
- The StudyProtocol class represents the content of the study protocol and can exist even before the information is put into document form. 
- The details of the structured plan for the study protocol are represented by the StudyProtocolVersion, so named because any aspect of the definition can change from version to version.Â  These details include, but are not limited to, the characteristics, specifications, objective(s), background, the pre-study/study/post-study portions of the plan (including the design, methodology, statistical considerations, organization).
- The protocol and its versions can each be represented in document form, respectively StudyProtocolDocument and StudyProtocolDocumentVersion.Â  A StudyProtocolDocument groups the various document versions (StudyProtocolDocumentVersions).
- The conduct of a study based on a study protocol definition is represented by the StudyExecution class.
